subject: Request for Access to Kaggle Competition Dataset for Academic Research

My name is Masum Mushfik Rifat, and I am currently a Computer Science undergrad student at East West University. I am writing to respectfully request access to the dataset used in the Kaggle competition titled "Credit score (Ericsson April 24) - Good deadline".

I am researching different datasets about the credit scores of bank customers, and this dataset would be extremely valuable for the empirical component of my work. The competitionâ€™s data aligns closely with the analytical needs of my project, and I intend to use it solely for academic purposes.

Thank you very much for considering my request. I would be grateful for any guidance on the appropriate procedure to obtain access or any alternative channels through which the data might be made available.

Warm regards,
